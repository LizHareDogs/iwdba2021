## Abstract


Working dog programs have an interest in the early identification of puppies who are likely to succeed in training. The [Penn Vet Working Dog Center](https://www.vet.upenn.edu/research/centers-laboratories/center/penn-vet-working-dog-center) begins training and fostering puppies at about eight weeks of age while collecting several types of behavioral data. The Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ) contains 100 items grouped into 14 subscales and is usually completed by fosters. The Behavior Checklist (BCL) contains 44 items which partially overlap with C-BARQ items and subscales. After matching within dog and age group, there were 86 records on 64 dogs. Spearman correlations were calculated as a measure of agreement between the BCL item scores and C-BARQ subscales and individual items using the Holm correction for multiple testing. When testing C-BARQ subscales, BCL and C-BARQ stranger-directed aggression were moderately correlated (0.51, p < 0.05), as were C-BARQ dog-directed aggression and BCL stranger-directed aggression (0.50, p < 0.01). When testing BCL items with individual C-BARQ items, C-BARQ dog-directed aggression items were moderately but significantly correlated with eight BCL items including resource guarding around people, stranger-directed aggression, dog-directed aggression, and resource guarding around dogs.

 stranger-directed aggression items were correlated with 12 BCL items including stranger-directed fear, stranger-directed aggression, and dog-directed aggression. The moderate correlations for fear and aggression and lack of correlation for other traits suggest that dogsâ€™ behavior may be different in their foster homes than in training or that trainers evaluate dogs differently than fosters.
