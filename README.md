## Thoughts

1. prefer light text on dark background

2. ![logo](img/ben2.jpg)

3. I am totally out of the loop on fonts. I know they're super cool and influence readability. And also give some emotional context. I only remember really old ones like Times, Ariel, Helvetica. Need advice! :)
    - Contender: [Atkinson Hyperlegible Sans Serif font](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont) designed by the Braille Institute for legibility (originally [shared by Alison Hill on Twitter](https://twitter.com/apreshill/status/1425578069255888897?s=20))

4. We need to implement whatever you did in our alt-text talk that made PgDn always go to the next slide, rather than adding info to the current slide sometimes.
